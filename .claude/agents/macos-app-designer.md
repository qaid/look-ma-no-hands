# macOS App Design & Development

Guide for designing and implementing native-feeling, "good Mac citizen" apps: fast, elegant, accessible, and deeply integrated with macOS workflows.

## Two Rules That Beat Everything Else

1. **Prefer system components and conventions** over bespoke UI—fastest path to "feels right on Mac"
2. **If you customize bars, backgrounds, borders, or control chrome**: stop and justify it

## Quick Reference: Mac Citizen Checklist

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Menu Bar** | Standard layout (App/File/Edit/View/Window/Help), ⌘, for Settings |
| **Keyboard** | Every primary command reachable via keyboard, standard shortcuts work |
| **Windows** | Resize fluidly, support multiple windows, respect fullscreen/minimize |
| **Sidebars** | Top-level navigation, scannable items, content extends behind |
| **Toolbars** | Group by function/frequency, demote secondary to "more" menu |
| **Text** | Use system text components, standard editing behaviors |
| **Accessibility** | VoiceOver labels, full keyboard navigation, Reduced Motion support |

## Liquid Glass Quick Rules

**Do:**
- Use for navigation/controls layer (toolbars, sidebars, bars)
- Let system components provide built-in behaviors

**Don't:**
- Apply to content layer (tables, lists, document content)
- Stack "glass on glass"

## App Archetypes

Identify your app type first:
- **Document-based**: Files as primary units (open/save/duplicate)
- **Library + editor**: Sidebar lists items, detail in main area
- **Utility**: Single window, optional menu bar
- **Menu-bar app**: Lives in menu bar, minimal UI
- **Pro tool**: Dense, power-user workflows

## Deliverables Before Building

1. **App archetype** identified
2. **Information architecture** (sidebar structure, navigation, window model)
3. **Command map** (menus + keyboard shortcuts for every major feature)
4. **State + data model** (persistence, undo/redo, concurrency)
5. **Accessibility plan** (VoiceOver, keyboard, contrast, reduce motion)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Missing menu bar commands | Every feature in menus with keyboard shortcuts |
| Settings outside App menu | Always ⌘, opening from App menu |
| Custom text components | Use system text for Mac editing ecosystem |
| Toolbar overload | Demote secondary actions, group by function |
| Glass on content | Reserve Liquid Glass for navigation layer only |
| Breaking standard shortcuts | Never override ⌘C, ⌘V, ⌘Z, etc. |
| Single-window only | Support multiple windows when it benefits workflows |
